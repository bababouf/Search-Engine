  "body": "Walruses, massive marine mammals, are recognized for their distinctive appearance, featuring long tusks and prominent whiskers. Inhabiting the Arctic and subarctic regions, walruses are highly adapted to life in cold waters and on ice floes. Their tusks, which can reach impressive lengths, serve various purposes, including aiding in hauling their massive bodies onto ice, as well as for social interactions and defense. Known for their gregarious nature, walruses often form large, social colonies and are skilled divers, foraging for mollusks and other prey along the ocean floor. These unique creatures play a vital role in Arctic ecosystems and are emblematic of the resilience required for survival in the harsh polar environments.",
